# jlox
An interpreter (implemented in Java) for the Lox programming language from Robert Nystrom's lovely book, *Crafting Interpreters.*

## How to use
First, build with `gradle build`.

From there, you can find the interpreter jar and call `java -jar interpreter-standalone.jar` on it normally.

The interpreter jar will be located at `interpreter/build/libs/interpreter-standalone.jar`.
