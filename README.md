# jlox
An interpreter (implemented in Java) for the Lox programming language from Robert Nystrom's lovely book, *Crafting Interpreters.*

## How to use
First, build with `gradle build`.

From there, you can either run the interpreter via [run.sh](./run.sh), or directly invoke `java -jar` on `interpreter-standalone.jar` yourself.

After building, the interpreter jar is located at `interpreter/build/libs/interpreter-standalone.jar`.
